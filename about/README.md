### List

Your website must include at least one list (ordered or unordered), at least one table, and at least one image.

### External CSS

Your website must have at least one stylesheet file.

```
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
```

- Your stylesheet(s) must use at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. You must use the #id selector at least once, and the .class selector at least once.
- Your stylesheet(s) must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.
- You must use Bootstrap 4 on your website, taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component, and using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.
- Your stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.
- In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

### The Python programming language
- [Learn more](https://github.com/python/cpython)
- [glot.io](https://glot.io/) - an open source pastebin with runnable snippets and API.
- Project [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
- Jupyter via [your browser](https://jupyter.org/try)
